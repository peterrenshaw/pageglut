IMPROVEMENTS

* Page queries URL
- list of URLS obtained
- when looping thru urls
+ check if url is requested by page?
+ ie: image, css file NOT .html file found as link in page
+ another hint is via content-type

* re-check resources for broken urls and fix
- sometimes resource links found on pages are relative
- when I do a check if they are valid, rel links will break
- fix them, then re-try
